He claims proficiency in Python and C++, and mentions working on AI projects, although no details are provided. He also lists skills in English conversation, office management, Microsoft Office, leadership, and customer service.  His resume includes his prior education: FSC Pre-Engineering at Government College of Science and primary education at Native School System.\n\n**Knowledge Rating:** Based on the limited information, it's difficult to accurately assess his AI knowledge on a scale of 1-10. He's clearly a beginner in the field, currently undertaking his bachelor's degree.  While he mentions \"successfully implemented projects,\" the absence of details makes it impossible to evaluate their complexity or his actual contribution.  A generous rating, considering his current student status and claimed skills, might be a **3/10**.  This acknowledges his foundational learning and initiative but emphasizes the need for more concrete demonstrations of his abilities to warrant a higher score.  He would need to showcase projects, detail his contributions, and demonstrate a deeper understanding of AI concepts to justify a higher rating.\n"
